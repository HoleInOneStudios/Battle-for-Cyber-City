Specification for “Battle for Cyber City”:
Intro Paragraph

Welcome to Battle for Cyber City, an engaging and educational game designed to teach young children about the crucial concepts of cybersecurity and the constant battle between hacking and protection. As the defender or the attacker, you will navigate through the various districts of Cyber City, such as "Business," "Hospital," "Fire/Police," "Industrial," "University," "Housing," "Fort Sam," and "Traffic Lights." Your objective is to strategically allocate your budget to either reinforce the city's defenses or compromise its critical infrastructure. Are you ready to test your skills and secure the future of Cyber City?

The locations are:
    Business
    Hospital
    Fire/Police

Phishing - 35%
Virus - 25%

Turns:

The game will consist of 10 rounds.
Each round will have a defender's turn followed by an attacker's turn.

Budget:

Both the defender and attacker will start with a budget of $50,000.



Actions per Turn:

Each player will have one turn per round, except the defender gets the first two moves.
Players can decide whether to spend their budget on attacking or defending Cyber City's districts.

Defender's Turn:

The defender's initial turn will allow for them to "defend" two different locations because in the real world, the defender gets the first chance.
The defender will start their turn and decide if they want to spend their budget on increasing different kinds of protections for one or multiple districts
When the defender applies cyber security tools, a virtual dice will be rolled to determine the success rate of the defense tactic.

Attacker's Turn:

After the defender's turn ends, the attacker will have the opportunity to apply hacks to Cyber City establishments, compromising its critical infrastructure.
When the attacker applies a hack, a virtual dice will be rolled to determine the success rate of the hack.

Compromise Threshold:

When the attacker's hacks are successful, the compromised percentage of the attacked district will increase, and the establishment attacked will have its lights shut off.
When the defender's tools are successful, the compromised percentage of districts will decrease, and establishments that had their lights turned off will turn back on.
This app simulates a game where players take turns as defenders and attackers, with a fixed budget to either defend or compromise Cyber City's districts. The defender's goal is to increase protection levels using their budget, while the attacker aims to successfully hack establishments. The success rates of defense tactics and hacks are determined through virtual dice rolls. When hacks are successful, the compromised percentage of districts increases, and establishments' lights are turned off. Successful defense tools reduce the compromised percentage and restore lights to previously affected establishments. For this game, once the lights are out, the lights are out - there is no recovery.
